##### Abstract 

In this project we aimed to backtest a trading strategy for the Korean Wan / US Dollar one month forward. We began with approximately seven months of historical data for seventy two different instruments. We cleaned these data to the point where they could be reliably used to construct a linear regression model for KWN+1M. We trained a linear regression model for KWN+1M using all possible data, and examined this model to find the most correlated instruments. We then trained another linear regression model using only those most correlated instruments (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56). We used this model to construct fair prices for KWN+1M during open hours. We then backtested a trading strategy based on these modelled prices using leaning and hedging in the most correlated instruments. [RESULTS GO HERE]
